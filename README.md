# Project using AWS, Jenkis, SonarQube, Docker

I'm recreating this old project for my resume, this is the basics of DevOps.

This project leverages the power of AWS, Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker to deliver a robust and scalable solution. 

- With AWS, we can easily deploy and manage our infrastructure using services such as EC2, S3, and RDS. 

- Jenkins allows us to automate our build and deployment processes, ensuring that our code is always tested and deployed in a consistent manner. 

- SonarQube helps us ensure the quality of our code by performing static code analysis and providing us with detailed reports on code quality and potential issues. 

- With Docker, we can easily package and distribute our application, ensuring that it can run consistently across different environments.

Together, these tools provide a powerful platform for developing and delivering high-quality software. By using AWS, we can easily scale our infrastructure to meet the demands of our users. Jenkins allows us to automate our processes, reducing the risk of human error and increasing efficiency. SonarQube helps us maintain high standards of code quality, ensuring that our application is reliable and maintainable. And Docker allows us to easily distribute our application, reducing the time and effort required to deploy it to different environments.
